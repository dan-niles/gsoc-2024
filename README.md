# Google Summer of Code 2024 - Kiwix

During the summer of 2024, I participated in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) with [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/), working on a project titled YouTube UI Revamp. This document outlines the initial tasks, changes made throughout the project, developments achieved, and work that remains to be done.

## About Kiwix

[Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/) is primarily an NGO dedicated to bringing internet content to everyone. To achieve this, Kiwix offers free and open-source offline web browsing, allowing users to download content in the form of [ZIM](https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_file_format) files and access it through [reading apps](https://kiwix.org/en/applications/) for offline viewing.

## Project Description

This project aims to improve the [Kiwix YouTube Scraper](https://github.com/openzim/youtube), which is designed to create ZIMs from YouTube videos. By enhancing the user interface for YouTube ZIMs, the goal is to create a more visually appealing and user-friendly design, making educational videos and other content more accessible for Kiwix users worldwide.
