# Google Summer of Code 2024 - Kiwix

During the summer of 2024, I participated in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) with [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/), working on a project titled **YouTube UI Revamp**. This document outlines the initial tasks, changes made throughout the project, developments achieved, and work that remains to be done.

## About Kiwix

Kiwix is a free and open-source offline web browser. Users can download content in the form of [ZIM](https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_file_format) files for offline viewing with Kiwix.

## Project Description

This project aims to improve the [Kiwix YouTube Scraper](https://github.com/openzim/youtube) by enhancing the user interface for YouTube ZIMs. The goal is to create a more visually appealing and user-friendly design, making educational videos and other content more accessible for Kiwix users worldwide.
